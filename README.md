CSBAnnotatorAddIn
=================

_This project is in an exerimental state._

Excel AddIn for annotation of experimental data and computational workflows.

The aims of this AddIn are:

1. Provide an easy way to annotate experimental data in an application (excel) that every wet lab scientist is familiar with
2. Provide a way to create computational workflows that start from raw data and end with results.
3. Create ISA and CWL compatible data models from the input
4. Provide an interface for remote execution of the defined workflows

Develop
-------

This project uses the [SAFE Stack](https://github.com/SAFE-Stack) to create a website that uses [office.js](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js) to interop with Excel.

The file [OfficeJS.fs](src/Client/OfficeJS.fs) contains Fable bindings autogenerated from the office.js typescript definitions.

to debug the AddIn locally, use the build target `OfficeDebug`:

`fake build -t OfficeDebug`

this will launch an Excel instance with the AddIn sideloaded.

However it is currently pretty hard to attach a debugger to the instance of edge that runs in
the Excel window. You can circumvent this issue by additionally testing in Excel online:

 - open Excel online in your favorite browser
 - create a blank new workbook (or use any workbook, but be warned that you can't undo stuff done via Office.js) 
 - Go to Insert > Office-Add-Ins and upload the manifest.xml file contained in this repo
    ![Add In Upload](docsrc/files/img/AddInUpload.png)
 - You will now have the full debug experience in your browser de tools.
